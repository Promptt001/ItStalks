# --- Boat Trap Prevention ---
# The stalker can no longer enter boats.

# --- Fears ---
# The stalker will avoid entering these radiuses and will try to path around the blocks.
# Each fear can be toggled and has its own radius.

  # Fear avoidance tuning (prevents the stalker from repeatedly entering the fear zone and fleeing)
  # Behaviour notes:
  #  - If the cursed player is INSIDE the fear radius, the stalker will stand still at the edge.
  #  - If the cursed player is OUTSIDE the radius but the fear zone blocks the direct path,
  #    the stalker will step around the perimeter until it has a clear route.
  # perimeter_buffer: extra distance added on top of each fear radius to create a stable "edge"
  # step_distance: how far (in blocks) each avoidance step tries to move per pathing update
  # inward_dot_threshold: how aggressively it switches to tangential movement around the fear zone
